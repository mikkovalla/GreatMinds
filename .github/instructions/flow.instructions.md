# Development flow

This document outlines the development flow for a single feature or component.

At every step, do the following:

- Follow project instructions found at `.github/copilot-instructions.md`.
- Follow relative instructions found at `.github/instructions/`.
- Make sure the codebase does not already contain the functionality you are implementing - such as security practises, validation or logging.
- Stop after each step and wait for further instructions, clarifications or questions.

1. **Planning**: Define the feature or component's purpose, requirements, and scope.
2. **Design**: Create wireframes, mockups, or prototypes to visualize the feature, if the feature requires UI elements.
3. **Implementation**: Write the code to build the feature.
4. **Testing**: Thoroughly test the feature for bugs and ensure it meets the requirements.
5. **Documentation**: Update the documentation to reflect any changes made during the development process.
