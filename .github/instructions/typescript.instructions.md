# TypeScript Coding Guidelines

You are a senior TypeScript programmer.

## TypeScript General Guidelines

### Basic Principles

- Use English for all code and documentation.
- Always declare the type of each variable and function (parameters and return value).
  - Create necessary types.
- Use JSDoc to document public classes and methods.
- Don't leave blank lines within a function.
- One export per file.
- Prefer Types over Interfaces.
  - Use interfaces only when you need to extend them.
- Enable `strict: true` in @tsconfig.json with additional flags:
  - `noImplicitAny: true`
  - `strictNullChecks: true`
  - `strictFunctionTypes: true`
  - `strictBindCallApply: true`
  - `strictPropertyInitialization: true`
  - `noImplicitThis: true`
  - `alwaysStrict: true`
  - `exactOptionalPropertyTypes: true`
- Never use `// @ts-ignore` or `// @ts-expect-error` without explanatory comments
- Use `--noEmitOnError` compiler flag to prevent generating JS files when TypeScript errors exist
- Do not ever use `any`. Ever. If you feel like you have to use `any`, use `unknown` instead.
- Explicitly type function parameters, return types, and object literals.
- Please don't ever use Enums. Use a union if you feel tempted to use an Enum.
- Use `readonly` modifiers for immutable properties and arrays
- Leverage TypeScript's utility types (`Partial`, `Required`, `Pick`, `Omit`, `Record`, etc.)
- Use discriminated unions with exhaustiveness checking for type narrowing
- Implement proper generics with appropriate constraints
- Use mapped types and conditional types to reduce type duplication
- Leverage `const` assertions for literal types
- Avoid magic numbers and define constants.
- Implement branded/nominal types for type-level validation

### Nomenclature

- Use PascalCase for classes.
- Use camelCase for variables, functions, and methods.
- Use kebab-case for file and directory names.
- Use UPPERCASE for environment variables.
- Use verbs for boolean variables. Example: isLoading, hasError, canDelete, etc.
- Use complete words instead of abbreviations and correct spelling.
  - Except for standard abbreviations like API, URL, etc.
  - Except for well-known abbreviations:
    - i, j for loops
    - err for errors
    - ctx for contexts

### Functions

- In this context, what is understood as a function will also apply to a method.
- Write short functions with a single purpose. Less than 20 instructions.
- Name functions with a verb and something else.
  - If it returns a boolean, use isX or hasX, canX, etc.
  - If it doesn't return anything, use executeX or saveX, etc.
- Avoid nesting blocks by:
  - Early checks and returns.
  - Extraction to utility functions.
- Use higher-order functions (map, set, filter, reduce, etc.) to avoid function nesting.
  - Use arrow functions for simple functions (less than 3 instructions).
  - Use named functions for non-simple functions.
- Use default parameter values instead of checking for null or undefined.
- Reduce function parameters using RO-RO
  - Use an object to pass multiple parameters.
  - Use an object to return results.
  - Declare necessary types for input arguments and output.
- Use a single level of abstraction.

### Data

- Don't abuse primitive types and encapsulate data in composite types.
- Avoid data validations in functions and use classes with internal validation.
- Prefer immutability for data.

### Classes

- Follow SOLID principles.
- Prefer composition over inheritance.
- Write small classes with a single purpose.
  - Less than 200 instructions.
  - Less than 10 public methods.
  - Less than 10 properties.

### Exceptions

- Use exceptions to handle errors you don't expect.
- If you catch an exception, it should be to:
  - Fix an expected problem.
  - Add context.
  - Otherwise, use a global handler.

### Testing

- Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert convention for tests.
- Name test variables clearly.
  - Follow the convention: inputX, mockX, actualX, expectedX, etc.
- Write unit tests for each public function.
  - Use test doubles to simulate dependencies.
    - Except for third-party dependencies that are not expensive to execute.
- Write acceptance tests for each module.
  - Follow the Given-When-Then convention.
